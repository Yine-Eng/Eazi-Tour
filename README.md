**Eazi Tour - Frontend**
Eazi Tour is a web application designed to help users explore destinations around the world. The app features a special tool that allows users to search for images of countries based on their continent of interest.

**Features**
**Eazi Destination Tool:** Users can search for destinations based on continents, which will trigger a tool that displays images of randomly selected countries.

**Triggerable Tool:** The special Eazi Destination Tool remains hidden on the homepage until certain conditions are met (e.g., a checkbox is triggered), at which point it is revealed and becomes interactive.

**Limited Requests:** The project is limited to 50 requests per hour due to the restrictions from the Unsplash API (free-tier limit). Each click of the search button under the Eazi Destination Tool section exhausts 4 out of the 50 available requests per hour.

**Usage**
1. Visit the homepage and explore the features.

2. Trigger the special tool in the home section by interacting with the app (e.g., checking the box).

3. Select a continent and click the search button to reveal destination images.


**Tech Stack**
1. HTML, CSS, JavaScript

2. Swiper.js for carousel functionality (review section)

3. ScrollReveal.js for animations
