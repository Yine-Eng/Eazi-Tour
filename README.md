# Eazi Tour 🌍

> A web application that lets users explore destinations around the world based on their continent of interest, with a tool that showcases images from various countries.

### Status: 🚀 Deployed

### 📅 Expected Updates:
I plan to continuously enhance the search capabilities and user experience for spontaneous travelers. Stay tuned for additional features!

### 🛠️ Tech Stack:
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Libraries:** Swiper.js (carousel), ScrollReveal.js (animations)
- **Backend:** Node.js & Express.js
- **APIs:** Unsplash API, Rest Countries API
- **Deployment:** Vercel (both frontend and backend)

### 🔥 Features:
- **Eazi Destination Tool:** Search for destinations based on continents. Trigger hidden tools that reveal country images when certain conditions (e.g., checkbox interactions) are met.
- **Limited Requests:** Due to Unsplash API limits (50 requests per hour), each click of the search button consumes 4 requests. Use wisely!
- **Random Image Selector:** The tool shows random country images, making each search unique and exciting.

### 🎯 How to Use:
1. **Explore**: Visit the homepage and explore its features.
2. **Trigger the Tool**: Interact with the app by checking the appropriate box to reveal the special destination search tool.
3. **Select a Continent**: Choose a continent and click "search" to reveal destination images.
4. **Enjoy the Adventure**: Experience the world through beautiful photos, and plan your next journey!
